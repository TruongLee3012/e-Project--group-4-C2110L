                    <div class="blog-title">How Often Should I Replace My Tooth Brush?</div>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>
                        When was the last time you replaced your toothbrush? We throw out expired foods, restock vitamins and supplements, and replace our beauty products often, but when it comes to health and beauty, it’s our dental hygiene that doesn’t get as much attention or thought as other areas of our regimen. However, there are important rules and tips you should follow for maintaining optimal dental health.
                    </p>                   
                    <div class="images">

                        When To Change Your Toothbrush
                    </div>                  
                    <p>
                        Most dentists, and the American Dental Association (ADA), recommend changing your toothbrush every 3 months. Overtime, toothbrushes go through normal wear and tear and become less effective with removing plaque from teeth and gums. Studies have found that around 3 months is when the bristles break down and lose effectiveness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One other consideration we don’t typically think about (and probably don’t like to think about) is that germs can hide and build up in toothbrush bristles. This makes it important to replace your toothbrush after you’ve had a cold, or risk possible reinfection.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fungus and bacteria can also develop in the bristles if not taken care of properly. After use, make sure you rinse off and dry your toothbrush thoroughly, storing uncovered in an upright position and keeping it away from other used toothbrushes. When traveling, be sure to cover your toothbrush head to protect it and reduce the spread of germs.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you can’t remember exactly how long it’s been, pay particular attention to the condition your toothbrush head is in–whether the bristles are worn out, fan out, or frayed, or especially if you see dark color changes, which is a sign of mold.
                    </p>
                    <div class="images">
                        <img src="../images/blog/tb2.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <div class="smalltitle">
                        What Happens If I Don’t Change My Toothbrush Often Enough?
                    </div>
                    <p>  
                        If knowing that bacteria and fungus accumulates on your toothbrush bristles overtime isn’t enough reason to replace your toothbrush more often, there are also a number of other risks and uninviting issues involved with not replacing your toothbrush. One risk includes damaging your gums, as old toothbrushes become ineffective with removing plaque from your teeth, which leads to gingivitis. Left untreated, gingivitis leads to infection, which can cause teeth to fall out.
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        Even more unappealing, you can get sick from overused toothbrushes (see: bacteria and fungus build up), your toothbrush can grow mold, or possibly the least appealing, you can ingest unwanted particles if stored near a toilet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I don’t know about you, but I’m going to go change my toothbrush right now and schedule a deep cleaning with my dentist.
                    </p>
                    <div class="images">

                    <div class="smalltitle">
                        How Often Should I Replace My Toothbrush?
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Ask your dentist during your next dental checkup and cleaning for recommendations about what you should be buying based off your individual needs, your particular dental health state, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some common suggestions among dental professionals are to look for toothbrushes with soft bristles, as hard bristles damage your teeth and gums, choose a toothbrush head size that touches one or two teeth at a time, use a toothpaste containing fluoride approved by the ADA, consider using mouthwash to further fight plaque and gingivitis, and don’t forget floss!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Consider investing in an electric toothbrush, as these have been proven to improve oral health beyond what a manual toothbrush can do by removing plaque, reducing gingivitis and eliminating teeth staining. They’ve also been shown to minimize the amount of plaque on the teeth of people with periodontal disease.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Do your research on what products fit your needs best, and don’t forget to ask your dentist for recommendations.

                    <br><br>
                    <p>
                        Bad breath, we all know what it is and we’ve all been embarrassed by our own breath from time to time. But what causes it?  Knowing and understanding what causes bad breath can help you prevent it and the embarrassment that often accompanies it. Read on to learn more about what causes bad breath and quit being afraid of getting close.
                    </p>
                    <div class="smalltitle">
                        What Causes Bad Breath?
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Also called halitosis, bad breath can be caused by a number of issues.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Food.</b> Some of the foods we eat can give us temporary bad breath. Garlic, onions, coffee, spicy or fragrant foods can leave your mouth less than fresh. Brush your teeth, chew sugar-free gum, or use mouthwash for a burst of freshness.
                    </p>
                    <div class="images">
                        <img src="../images/blog/bb1.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        <b>Tobacco.</b> Smoking and tobacco use not only cause bad breath, they can create oral cancers, stain teeth and irritate your gums. Consider a tobacco free lifestyle to reduce the negative effects.
                    </p>
                    <div class="images">
                        <img src="../images/blog/bb2.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        <b>Dental issues.</b> Bad breath can be caused by dental issues such as gum disease or cavities. Crowded teeth or ill-fitting dental appliances can also cause bad breath. See your dentist to rule out any oral care issues as a culprit.
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        <b>Bacteria.</b> Without proper brushing, flossing, and regular visits to the dentist, bacteria is not being removed from your mouth. The build-up of this sticky bacteria can lead to bad breath. By following the ADA recommendation of brushing twice a day, flossing daily, and routine visits to the dentist, you can keep bacteria in check.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Dry mouth.</b> Lack of saliva creates dry mouth, which may be a side effect of medications, smoking, or mouth breathing or it could be a symptom of an underlying health concern. Talk to your dentist about dry mouth for the best remedies for both dry mouth and resulting bad breath.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Disease.</b> Sinus infections, tonsillitis, respiratory issues and even diabetes can result in bad breath. Your doctor may prescribe medication for these conditions which may make dry mouth, and resulting bad breath worse. Talk to your doctor if your side effects are problematic.
                    </p>

                        Addressing Bad Breath
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        In order to address bad breath, you need to understand what’s causing it. The best way to discover the underlying reason for bad breath is being honest about your lifestyle and habits with both your dentist and doctor to create the best approach to getting rid of bad breath. Many times bad breath can be avoided by living a tobacco free life, keeping a good oral health care routine (brushing twice a day and flossing daily) and of course seeing your dentist at least twice a year.
